## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1: Open Directly (Simplest)

1. Download or clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/everwind-alchemy.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder
3. Double-click `index.html`

> ⚠️ Note: Some browsers may block loading local JSON files due to security restrictions.

---

### Option 2: Run a Local Server (Recommended)

Running a local server avoids issues with loading JSON files.

#### 🐍 Using Python (easy)

If you have Python installed:

```
cd everwind-alchemy
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

---

#### 🟢 Using Node.js

If you have Node.js installed:

```
npx serve .
```

## 🗂️ Data Files

### `items.json`

Contains item definitions and their associated effects. Alchemy effects is an array even when there is only one effect.

---

### `effects.json`

Defines all possible alchemy effects. And the location of their respective images.

---

## 🖼️ Images

* All images should be placed in the `/images` folder
* Reference images in `items.json` and `effects.json` using `/images/{image file name}`

---

## ⚙️ Customization

You can easily extend the app by:

* Adding new items to `items.json`
* Adding new effects to `effects.json`
* Dropping new images into the `/images` folder
* Updating the UI in `index.html`

## 💡 Notes

If something doesn’t work, it’s almost always due to how your browser handles local files. When in doubt, use a local server.
